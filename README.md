## 🔍 Project Description

Startups play a critical role in India's economic growth. This project investigates the relationship between funding and startup success using real-world data, focusing on:

- Industry-wise funding behavior
- Regional startup success patterns
- Impact of funding size on startup performance
- Post-COVID startup landscape

## 🧠 Methods Used

- ✅ **Descriptive Statistics**  
- ✅ **Chi-Square Test** – To evaluate association between categorical variables  
- ✅ **T-Test (Unequal Variances)** – For comparing success means  
- ✅ **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)** – For industry/location-based comparisons  
- ✅ **Linear Regression** – To model the relationship between funding & success  
- ✅ **Visualization Tools** – Boxplots, bar graphs, and correlation charts

## 🧩 Features

- 📌 Summary statistics on startup funding distribution  
- 📌 Probability analysis of receiving funding  
- 📌 Industry-wise comparison of funding and success rates  
- 📌 COVID-era startup performance case study  
- 📌 Interactive plots and insights using Python libraries  

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- 💡 **Tech and Healthcare** startups show higher success rates.  
- 💡 **Delhi and Hyderabad** emerge as high-performing startup hubs.  
- 💡 A **positive correlation** exists between funding and success (~0.7% success increase per ₹1M).  
- 💡 Despite high success, **healthcare doesn't receive statistically more funding** (p > 0.05).  
- 💡 **Urban startups** tend to outperform rural counterparts.

## 📚 Case Study Highlights

- COVID boosted **online education** and **healthcare** startups.  
- Funding isn't the only driver; **industry type and location** also play key roles.  
- Not all high-performing industries attract more funding, suggesting biases or investor hesitation.
